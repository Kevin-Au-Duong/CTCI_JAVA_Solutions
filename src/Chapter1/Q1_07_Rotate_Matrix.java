 * Question 1.7
 * Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
 * bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
 *
 *      This question touches on matrices, and because I'm unfamiliar with representing matrices in Java, I
 *      had a peek at the solutions just to make sure my representation method is in-line.
 *      Just a tiny peek, no cheating involved. Pinky promise.
